## About

This repository is meant for a **comprehensive learning path in Machine Learning**, from foundational concepts to advanced techniques, using well-documented Jupyter notebooks, hands-on examples, and real-world project work. It is ideal for learners who:

- are new to ML and want a structured journey  
- want to build solid foundational understanding (numpy, pandas, statistics)  
- want to learn data preprocessing, feature engineering, model building, evaluation, and practical deployment concepts

## Structure / Curriculum

Here‚Äôs a high-level view of the topics covered so far:

| Module | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Foundational Libraries** | NumPy, Pandas ‚Äî for data manipulation, arrays, tables etc. |
| **Visualization & EDA** | Data visualization tools & exploratory data analysis techniques. |
| **Data Collection & Web Scraping** | Techniques to gather data, from web scraping to APIs. |
| **Databases** | Basics of databases, querying etc. |
| **Probability & Statistics** | Distributions, Central Limit Theorem etc. |
| **Feature Engineering (FE)** | Standardization, Normalization, Encoding, Missing Values, Outlier Detection etc. |

More advanced topics and projects will be added in future modules.
